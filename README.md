# [WebXR Export](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export/)

You can [check the live demo here](https://de-panther.github.io/unity-webxr-export/Build).

Develop and export WebXR experiences using the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/).

WebXR Export supports both Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality [WebXR API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) immersive sessions.

It integrates the WebXR JavaScript API to [Unity WebGL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl.html) and lets you develop experiences in the familiar editor using C#.

#### More features

Spectator Camera

### üìä Polyfilled WebXR / WebVR

If the user does not have supported headset, browser or device, the content will still work through the use of the [WebXR Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill).

### üì± Mobile support

This asset works by utilizing Unity's WebGL platform support and therefore shares the same limitations. Because of this, mobile support is limited and may not work. We did made sure to make it light, so mobile devices would be able to handle it, and it is able to run on high end mobile devices with some optimizations. See [Unity's WebGL browser compatibility](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/webgl-browsercompatibility.html).
